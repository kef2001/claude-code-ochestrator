## Remaining Improvements to Add

From the original improvements.txt file, the following items still need tasks created:

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Add consensus mechanism when multiple workers complete similar tasks
- Create worker specialization profiles (code, research, analysis)
- Add dynamic subagent spawning for complex tasks

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing workers
- Add task result validation before marking complete
- Create fallback strategies for failed tasks
- Implement progressive retry with different approaches

### Performance Optimization
- Add task complexity analyzer to assign appropriate models
- Implement result caching for similar tasks
- Create task batching for related small tasks
- Add parallel tool calling within workers

### Observability & Monitoring
- Add detailed task execution traces
- Implement performance metrics dashboard
- Create task success/failure analytics
- Add resource usage monitoring per worker

### Enhanced Task Management
- Add task templates for common patterns
- Implement task dependency visualization
- Create task estimation based on historical data
- Add automatic task decomposition for large tasks

## Summary

Successfully created **21 new tasks** (Tasks 4-24) covering three major improvement areas:
- Checkpoint system implementation
- Dynamic worker allocation
- Inter-worker communication

The task creation system is working well, breaking down high-level improvements into actionable, dependent tasks with appropriate priorities.
