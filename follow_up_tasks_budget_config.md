# Budget Configuration System - Follow-up Tasks

## Review Summary
Task #34 "Budget configuration system" was marked as completed but no actual implementation was found. The system needs to be built from scratch.

## Required Follow-up Tasks

### 1. Implement Token Budget Configuration Schema (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add a `budget` section to CONFIG_SCHEMA in config_manager.py
- Include properties:
  - `max_tokens_per_task`: Maximum tokens allowed per individual task
  - `max_tokens_per_worker`: Maximum tokens per worker instance
  - `total_budget_limit`: Overall token budget for the entire orchestration
  - `budget_warning_threshold`: Percentage threshold for warnings (e.g., 80%)
  - `budget_enforcement_mode`: strict/soft enforcement
- Add validation methods for budget values

### 2. Create TokenBudgetManager Class (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Create new file: `claude_orchestrator/budget_manager.py`
- Implement core functionality:
  - `record_usage(task_id, model, tokens_used)`: Track token consumption
  - `check_budget_available(task_id, estimated_tokens)`: Pre-check before API calls
  - `get_remaining_budget()`: Calculate available tokens
  - `get_usage_report()`: Generate detailed usage statistics
  - `reset_budget()`: Reset counters for new orchestration runs
- Integrate with worker_executor.py and manager.py

### 3. Add Budget Enforcement to Orchestrator (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Modify `worker_executor.py`:
  - Check budget before making API calls
  - Record actual token usage after calls
  - Halt execution when limits reached
- Modify `manager.py`:
  - Include budget status in progress updates
  - Make task assignment decisions based on remaining budget
- Add budget information to task results and progress reports

### 4. Create Budget CLI Commands (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Add commands to task_master.py:
  - `budget-status`: Show current usage and limits
  - `budget-set`: Configure budget limits
  - `budget-reset`: Reset usage counters
- Update help documentation

### 5. Add Budget Persistence (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Store token usage data for historical tracking
- Create budget reports for completed orchestrations
- Allow loading previous usage data for analysis

## Implementation Priority
Start with tasks 1-3 as they form the core functionality. Tasks 4-5 can be added once the basic system is working.
