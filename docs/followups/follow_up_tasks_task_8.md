# Follow-up Tasks for Task ID 8: Task Resumption

## Critical Missing Functionality

The checkpoint system was only partially implemented. While it can save checkpoints, it cannot resume from them.

## Required Follow-up Tasks:

### 1. HIGH PRIORITY: Implement Task Resumption Logic
- Add CLI argument `--resume` or `--resume-from-checkpoint` to main.py
- Implement logic in enhanced_orchestrator.py to:
  - Detect incomplete tasks with saved checkpoints on startup
  - Load checkpoint data and restore task state
  - Resume execution from the last checkpoint
- Integrate with existing checkpoint manager

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY: Add Recovery Manager
- Implement the RecoveryManager class as designed in checkpoint_architecture.md
- Add automatic recovery strategies:
  - Retry with backoff
  - Circuit breaker integration
  - Fallback mechanisms
- Use checkpoint data for intelligent retry decisions

### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Create Comprehensive Tests
- Unit tests for checkpoint_system.py
- Integration tests for full resumption scenarios
- Test failure and recovery paths
- Test checkpoint persistence and restoration

### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Add User Interface for Resumption
- Prompt user when incomplete tasks are detected
- Show available checkpoints with task details
- Allow selection of specific checkpoint to resume from
- Add progress indicators for resumed tasks

### 5. LOW PRIORITY: Documentation and Examples
- Update README with checkpoint/resumption usage
- Add examples of resuming interrupted tasks
- Document recovery strategies and configuration options

## Implementation Notes:

The foundation exists in `checkpoint_system.py` with proper data structures and storage. The key missing piece is connecting this to the actual task execution flow to enable resumption.

Priority should be given to tasks 1 and 2 as they deliver the core functionality promised by Task ID 8.
