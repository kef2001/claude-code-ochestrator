# Follow-up Task for Task 25

## Task Details
- **Title**: Redesign Feature Flag Architecture
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Redesign Feature Flag Architecture with proper components: Include flag storage (JSON file), evaluation engine, flag types (boolean/percentage/variant), targeting rules, and integration API. Follow Simplicity First principle with minimal dependencies

## Rationale
The original design (Task 25) was too generic and lacked specific feature flag components. The design showed placeholder components instead of actual feature flag architecture.

## Required Components
1. **Flag Storage System**
   - JSON file-based storage for simplicity
   - Schema definition for flag structure
   
2. **Evaluation Engine**
   - Logic for evaluating flag values
   - Support for different flag types
   
3. **Flag Types**
   - Boolean flags (on/off)
   - Percentage rollout flags
   - Variant flags (A/B testing)
   
4. **Targeting Rules**
   - User-based targeting
   - Environment-based targeting
   - Custom attribute matching
   
5. **Integration API**
   - Simple Python API for flag checking
   - Minimal dependencies

## Success Criteria
- Clear, specific architecture components
- Follows Simplicity First principle
- Implementable with minimal external dependencies
- Includes concrete implementation details
