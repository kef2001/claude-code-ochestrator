# Claude Orchestrator - Anthropic Improvements Roadmap

Based on Anthropic's best practices for AI agent systems, this roadmap outlines advanced improvements to enhance the orchestrator's capabilities.

## 1. Advanced Feedback Loops üîÑ

### Current State
- Basic success/failure feedback
- Limited code quality insights

### Improvements
- **Static Analysis Integration**: Real-time code quality feedback with ruff and mypy
- **Automated Testing**: Immediate test execution with detailed results
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Safe environment for code testing

## 2. Enhanced Cognitive Architecture üß†

### Current State
- Linear task execution
- Limited self-assessment

### Improvements
- **ReviewerAgent**: Critical analysis of outputs before completion
- **Plan Validation**: Verify task decomposition before execution
- **Self-Reflection**: Agents learn from their outputs

## 3. Human-AI Collaboration ü§ù

### Current State
- Post-hoc human review
- Limited interaction during execution

### Improvements
- **Active Intervention**: Agents request help when uncertain
- **Interactive Feedback**: Real-time collaboration interface
- **Progressive Refinement**: Iterative improvement with human input

## 4. Dynamic Agent Specialization üéØ

### Current State
- General-purpose workers
- Uniform task handling

### Improvements
- **Specialized Agents**: Expert agents for specific task types
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent task-to-agent assignment
- **Performance Profiling**: Optimize agent allocation

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation** (High Priority)
   - Static Analysis Integration
   - ReviewerAgent Implementation
   - Active Intervention System

2. **Phase 2 - Enhancement** (Medium Priority)
   - Automated Test Execution
   - Plan Validation
   - Specialized Agent Framework

3. **Phase 3 - Optimization** (Lower Priority)
   - Sandboxed Execution
   - Self-Reflection Mechanism
   - Performance Profiling

## Expected Benefits

- **Quality**: 50%+ reduction in code defects
- **Efficiency**: 30%+ faster task completion
- **Reliability**: 80%+ first-attempt success rate
- **Collaboration**: 10x faster human feedback cycles
