# Task 35 Review: Budget enforcement

## Review Summary

**Task Status**: NOT COMPLETED - No implementation found

The task "Budget enforcement" (ID: 35) was marked as completed, but upon thorough review, **no actual budget enforcement implementation exists** in the codebase:

1. **Missing Budget Configuration**: The CONFIG_SCHEMA in config_manager.py:42 has no budget-related properties
2. **No Budget Manager**: No budget_manager.py or similar module exists
3. **No Token Tracking**: No token usage tracking or enforcement mechanisms found
4. **No Budget CLI**: No CLI commands for budget management

## Issues Identified

1. **False Completion**: Task marked as done without implementation
2. **Prerequisite Missing**: Budget configuration system (Task 34) also not implemented
3. **No Integration Points**: Worker and manager modules lack budget hooks

## Required Follow-up Tasks

Based on the existing follow_up_tasks_budget_config.md file, the following tasks need to be created:

### High Priority
1. Implement Token Budget Configuration Schema
2. Create TokenBudgetManager Class  
3. Add Budget Enforcement to Orchestrator

### Medium Priority
4. Create Budget CLI Commands
5. Add Budget Persistence

## Recommendation

This task should be reopened or new tasks created to implement the actual budget enforcement functionality. The system currently has no ability to track or limit token usage, which is critical for cost control.
