# RollbackManager Unit Tests Review

## Task Review Summary

### Task Details
- **Task ID**: d7043776-8c23-4f87-8c47-849141b08011
- **Title**: Create comprehensive unit tests for RollbackManager
- **Expected Output**: Unit tests in tests/test_rollback.py

### Review Findings

1. **Task Completion Status**: ‚ùå **NOT COMPLETED**
   - The worker output indicates only a high-level plan was created
   - No actual test file was created at tests/test_rollback.py
   - No tests directory exists in the project
   - No RollbackManager implementation exists yet

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - Worker did not execute the actual implementation
   - Output shows "Note: In a real execution, this would create actual code files"
   - This appears to be a placeholder response rather than actual work

3. **Missing Prerequisites**:
   - RollbackManager class doesn't exist yet
   - Tests directory needs to be created
   - No existing rollback implementation to test against

### Follow-up Tasks Created

1. **Implement RollbackManager** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Create claude_orchestrator/rollback_manager.py
   - Implement checkpoint creation, restoration, listing, deletion
   - Add version compatibility and error handling
   
2. **Create RollbackManager Unit Tests** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Create tests/ directory
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests in tests/test_rollback.py
   - Cover all functionality including edge cases

### Recommendations

1. The task execution system needs improvement to ensure workers actually implement code rather than just providing plans
2. Prerequisites should be checked before assigning test creation tasks
3. Task dependencies should be enforced (can't test what doesn't exist)

### Worker Performance Assessment

- **Quality**: Poor - No actual implementation delivered
- **Completeness**: 0% - Only provided a conceptual plan
- **Follow-up Required**: Yes - Complete reimplementation needed
