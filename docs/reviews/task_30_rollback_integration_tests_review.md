# Task 30: Rollback Integration Tests Review

## Summary
Task 30 aimed to develop integration tests for rollback behavior across the entire system. However, the implementation was not completed properly. The worker output only provided a high-level plan without any actual implementation.

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **No Actual Implementation**: The worker only provided a generic plan without creating any actual test files or code
2. **No Rollback Manager Exists**: The codebase currently lacks a RollbackManager implementation to test against
3. **No Test Directory**: The project doesn't have a tests directory structure set up
4. **Missing Dependencies**: No rollback functionality exists in the main codebase (claude_orchestrator/)

### Implementation Gaps
- No integration test files created
- No test fixtures or mock data
- No test scenarios defined
- No test runner configuration
- No CI/CD integration for tests

## Required Follow-up Tasks

### Prerequisites
1. Implement the actual RollbackManager component
2. Create test directory structure
3. Set up testing framework (pytest)

### Integration Test Implementation
1. Create comprehensive integration tests covering:
   - Task rollback scenarios
   - Partial rollback handling
   - State consistency after rollback
   - Multi-task rollback coordination
   - Error recovery during rollback

## Recommendation
This task should be marked as **failed** and needs complete re-implementation after the prerequisites are met.
