# Task 32 Review: Create rollback test fixtures and mocks

## Task Summary
- **Task ID**: 32
- **Title**: Create rollback test fixtures and mocks
- **Description**: Develop reusable test fixtures and mocks for rollback testing
- **Status**: Implementation NOT completed

## Review Findings

### Critical Issues

1. **No Implementation Found**: The worker claims to have completed the task, but no actual code was created:
   - No test fixtures were created
   - No mock objects were implemented
   - No test utility files were added to the codebase
   - The worker output only contains placeholder text stating "In a real execution, this would create actual code files"

2. **Design Document Mismatch**: The design document at `/designs/task_32_design.md` is for a completely different task (token tracking system), not rollback test fixtures.

### Expected Implementation

The task should have created:
1. Test fixtures for rollback scenarios (e.g., state snapshots, test data)
2. Mock objects for rollback dependencies (e.g., file system, database, API clients)
3. Reusable test utilities for rollback testing
4. Documentation on how to use the fixtures and mocks

### Recommendation

This task needs to be completely re-implemented. The worker execution appears to have been simulated rather than actually executing the required implementation.

## Follow-up Actions Required

Creating follow-up tasks to properly implement the rollback test fixtures and mocks.
