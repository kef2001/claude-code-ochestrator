# Task 28: Monitoring System Review

## Review Summary

Task 28 requested implementation of a monitoring system with metrics collection for feature usage and errors. However, the task was processed by the inline executor with only a generic completion message, and **no actual monitoring implementation was created**.

## Current State

After thorough examination of the codebase:

1. **No dedicated monitoring module exists** - No `monitoring_system.py` or similar file was created
2. **Existing infrastructure:**
   - `execution_tracer.py`: Provides task execution tracing and analytics
   - `feature_flags.py`: Basic feature flag system without usage tracking
   - `claude_error_handler.py`: Error handling without metrics collection

## Issues Identified

1. **No Feature Usage Metrics**: The feature flag system doesn't track usage statistics
2. **No Error Metrics Collection**: Errors are handled but not aggregated or analyzed
3. **No Metrics Dashboard**: No way to view collected metrics
4. **No Persistence**: No storage mechanism for historical metrics data

## Follow-up Tasks Created

I've created 4 high-priority follow-up tasks to properly implement the monitoring system:

### Task 29: Create Monitoring Module
- Build core `monitoring_system.py` with MetricsCollector class
- Integrate with FeatureFlags for usage tracking
- Implement feature access counters

### Task 30: Add Error Metrics Collection
- Create ErrorMetrics class for error tracking
- Integrate with existing error handling
- Categorize errors by type

### Task 31: Create Metrics Dashboard
- Build reporting functionality
- Display usage and error statistics
- Add export capabilities

### Task 32: Add Metrics Persistence
- Implement SQLite storage
- Add data retention policies
- Enable historical analysis

## Recommendation

The monitoring system requires proper implementation from scratch. The follow-up tasks provide a structured approach to building a comprehensive monitoring solution that tracks both feature usage and errors as originally requested.
