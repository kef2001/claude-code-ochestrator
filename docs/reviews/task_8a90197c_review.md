# Task 8a90197c Review Summary

**Task ID**: 8a90197c-d450-4bd9-a6d9-132b98ac9f14
**Title**: Add documentation for RollbackManager usage in docs/rollback.md
**Status**: FAILED ‚ùå

## Review Summary

The task to create RollbackManager documentation was not completed. The worker provided only a generic completion message without creating any actual documentation.

### Critical Issues:

1. **No rollback.md file created**: The documentation file was never created in the docs directory
2. **RollbackManager not implemented**: The RollbackManager class doesn't exist in the codebase yet
3. **Task sequencing error**: Documentation was requested before implementation

### Root Cause Analysis:

This task failed because it attempted to document a feature that hasn't been implemented yet. The RollbackManager class and rollback functionality are completely absent from the codebase, making it impossible to write meaningful documentation.

### Required Follow-up Tasks:

1. **Implement RollbackManager** (High Priority)
   - Create `claude_orchestrator/rollback_manager.py`
   - Implement checkpoint creation and restoration
   - Add automatic rollback triggers
   - Integrate with OpusManager

2. **Create rollback.md documentation** (Medium Priority)
   - Should be done AFTER implementation
   - Include usage examples
   - Document best practices
   - Explain checkpoint management strategies

3. **Add rollback tests** (Medium Priority)
   - Unit tests for RollbackManager
   - Integration tests with OpusManager
   - Test rollback scenarios

### Recommendations:

1. Block documentation tasks until implementation is complete
2. Review task dependencies before execution
3. Implement proper task sequencing validation

## Next Steps:

The RollbackManager implementation should be prioritized as it's a critical missing component referenced throughout the codebase planning documents.
