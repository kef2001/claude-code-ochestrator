# Follow-up Tasks for Task 30: Admin Interface

## Review Summary

Task 30 was not completed successfully. The worker only provided a high-level outline without any actual implementation.

## Required Follow-up Tasks

### High Priority Tasks

1. **Create Admin Interface API Endpoints**
   - Implement CRUD operations for feature flag management
   - Include proper authentication and authorization
   - RESTful API design with proper error handling

2. **Build Admin Interface Frontend**
   - Create React/Vue/Angular components for the admin UI
   - Implement forms for creating and editing feature flags
   - Add table view for listing all feature flags
   - Include search and filtering capabilities

3. **Implement Security Layer**
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Add audit logging for all admin actions
   - Secure API endpoints with proper validation

### Medium Priority Tasks

4. **Create Database Schema**
   - Design tables for feature flags storage
   - Add indexes for performance
   - Implement migration scripts

5. **Add Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all API endpoints
   - Integration tests for the admin workflow
   - UI component tests
   - Security penetration tests

6. **Write Documentation**
   - API documentation with examples
   - Admin user guide
   - Developer documentation for extending the interface

### Implementation Notes

The original task failed because it only provided a conceptual outline. The actual implementation requires:
- Creating multiple code files
- Setting up proper project structure
- Implementing actual functionality
- Following best practices for security and performance
