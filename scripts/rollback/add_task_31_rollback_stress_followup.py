Requirements:
1. Create test_rollback_stress.py in tests/stress/ directory
2. Implement concurrent rollback scenarios:
   - Multiple workers performing rollbacks simultaneously
   - Race conditions between rollback and new task execution
   - Rollback during checkpoint creation
   - Cascading rollbacks across dependent tasks
3. Use Python's asyncio and threading for concurrency testing
4. Include proper test fixtures and cleanup
5. Ensure tests can run in CI/CD pipeline

Expected test scenarios:
- 10+ concurrent rollback operations
- Mixed rollback and execution operations
- Rollback chain reactions
- Resource contention handling""",

   - Single rollback operation time
   - Batch rollback performance (10, 100, 1000 operations)
   - Memory usage during rollback
   - Disk I/O impact
   - Database query performance
3. Generate performance reports in JSON and HTML formats
4. Set up performance regression detection
5. Create visualization of benchmark results

Metrics to track:
- Average rollback time by task complexity
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Rollback success rate under load
- Queue processing throughput during rollbacks""",

Test cases to implement:

5. Rollback when dependent tasks are locked
6. Network failures during distributed rollback
7. Database connection loss during rollback
8. Rollback of partially executed tasks
9. Circular dependency rollback scenarios
10. Rollback with custom resource cleanup failures

Requirements:

- Use pytest fixtures for failure injection
- Mock system failures appropriately
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery
- Document expected vs actual behavior for each edge case""",

   - Identified bottlenecks and limitations
   - Recommendations for production use

2. Establish performance thresholds:
   - Maximum acceptable rollback time by task type
   - Concurrent rollback operation limits
   - Resource usage thresholds
   - Error rate tolerances

3. Create rollback performance dashboard mockup
4. Document rollback best practices based on test results

- Markdown documentation with embedded charts
- Performance threshold configuration file
- Rollback monitoring guidelines
- Production readiness checklist""",
