# Implement Partial Rollback Strategy

## Task ID: fe1f453a-7d8d-43d7-832c-7e464e24573d

## Overview
Design and implement partial rollback for selective component restoration. Include: 1) Component registry to track rollback-capable components, 2) Component state isolation mechanisms, 3) Dependency tracking between components, 4) Selective rollback execution with dependency resolution, 5) Component state validation after partial rollback

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
