## Task ID: c8a010f4-8139-4325-b19b-1df9ff7753c4

## Overview
Design and implement a StateSnapshot class for capturing complete system state before operations. Include: 1) Methods to capture current state of all orchestrator components (task queue, worker states, configuration), 2) Serialization to disk for persistence, 3) Validation of snapshot integrity, 4) Timestamp and metadata tracking. Save to claude_orchestrator/rollback/state_snapshot.py

## Design Details
Design and implement a StateSnapshot class for capturing complete system state before operations. Include: 1) Methods to capture current state of all orchestrator components (task queue, worker states, configuration), 2) Serialization to disk for persistence, 3) Validation of snapshot integrity, 4) Timestamp and metadata tracking. Save to claude_orchestrator/rollback/state_snapshot.py

## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
