# Create feedback storage database schema

## Task ID: 0648766b-87a7-4aff-8a36-925662156a53

## Overview
Design and implement the SQLite database schema for feedback storage

## Design Details
Create tables for feedback entries, review history, task associations, and metadata. Include proper indexes and constraints

## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
