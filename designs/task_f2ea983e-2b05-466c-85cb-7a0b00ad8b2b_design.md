# Implement Recovery Point Management

## Task ID: f2ea983e-2b05-466c-85cb-7a0b00ad8b2b

## Overview
Design recovery point system for rollback operations. Include: 1) Recovery point creation API with metadata, 2) Automatic recovery point generation on critical operations, 3) Recovery point storage and indexing, 4) Recovery point selection strategies, 5) Recovery point cleanup and retention policies

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
