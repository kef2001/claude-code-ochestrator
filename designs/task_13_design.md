# Task: Task Request: Design and implement comprehensive rollback strategies including: 1) Full rollback - c

## Task ID: 13

## Overview
Task Request: Design and implement comprehensive rollback strategies including: 1) Full rollback - complete system state restoration, 2) Partial rollback - selective component rollback, 3) Selective rollback - granular operation-level rollback. Include state tracking mechanisms, recovery point management, rollback triggers, and error handling.

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
