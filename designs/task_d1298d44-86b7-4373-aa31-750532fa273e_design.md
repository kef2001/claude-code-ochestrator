## Task ID: d1298d44-86b7-4373-aa31-750532fa273e

## Overview
Implement full rollback strategy for the Claude Code Orchestrator: Design and implement a complete rollback mechanism that can revert all task executions, state changes, and outputs to a previous checkpoint. Include transaction boundaries, state snapshots, and recovery procedures. The implementation should handle: 1) Complete system state reversion, 2) Task execution history rollback, 3) File system changes reversion, 4) Database/persistent state rollback

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
