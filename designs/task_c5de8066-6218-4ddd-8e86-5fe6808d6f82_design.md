# Implement Full Rollback Strategy

## Task ID: c5de8066-6218-4ddd-8e86-5fe6808d6f82

## Overview
Design and implement full rollback strategy for complete system state restoration. Include: 1) State snapshot mechanism to capture full system state before operations, 2) Storage strategy for state snapshots (file-based or in-memory), 3) Restoration process to revert entire system to previous state, 4) Validation mechanism to ensure restored state integrity, 5) Cleanup of intermediate states after successful restoration

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
