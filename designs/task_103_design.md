# Implement conflict resolution for shared resources

## Task ID: 103

## Overview
Add conflict detection and resolution for partial rollbacks affecting shared resources. Create SharedResourceRegistry, conflict detection during rollback planning, resolution strategies (merge/priority-based/user-prompted), and rollback transaction support

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
