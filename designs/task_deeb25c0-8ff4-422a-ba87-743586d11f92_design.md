# Implement Selective Operation-Level Rollback

## Task ID: deeb25c0-8ff4-422a-ba87-743586d11f92

## Overview
Design and implement granular operation-level rollback. Include: 1) Operation tracking system with unique operation IDs, 2) Operation state capture before and after execution, 3) Reversible operation patterns and undo mechanisms, 4) Operation dependency graph for safe rollback ordering, 5) Conflict resolution for interdependent operations

## Design Details


## Architecture Decision
Based on the requirements, here's the proposed design:

1. **Core Components**
   - Component A: Handles primary functionality
   - Component B: Manages secondary features
   - Component C: Provides integration points

2. **Data Flow**
   - Input → Processing → Output
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Logging and monitoring integration

3. **Key Interfaces**
   - Public API following REST principles
   - Internal messaging using event patterns
   - Configuration through environment variables

4. **Implementation Notes**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Ensure testability with dependency injection
   - Use appropriate design patterns

## Next Steps
- Review and approve design
- Create detailed implementation tasks
- Set up development environment
