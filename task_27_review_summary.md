# Task 27 Review Summary: Rollout Percentage Control

## Review Status: ‚ùå FAILED

### Task Details
- **Task ID**: 27
- **Title**: Rollout Percentage Control
- **Description**: Add percentage-based rollout capability

### Review Findings

#### 1. Task Completion Status: NOT COMPLETED
The worker output claims the task was completed, but no actual implementation was found in the codebase. This appears to be a placeholder or mock response without any real work done.

#### 2. Current State Analysis
The existing feature flag system (`claude_orchestrator/feature_flags.py`) only supports:
- Simple boolean on/off flags
- Static string, number, and JSON values
- Basic CRUD operations via CLI

**Missing Rollout Capabilities:**
- No percentage-based feature rollout
- No user identification/bucketing mechanism
- No gradual rollout controls
- No A/B testing capabilities
- No canary deployment support

#### 3. Required Implementation
To properly implement percentage-based rollout, the following components are needed:

1. **User/Request Identification**
   - Unique identifier for bucketing (user ID, session ID, etc.)
   - Consistent hashing mechanism

2. **Percentage Evaluation Logic**
   - Algorithm to determine if a user falls within the rollout percentage
   - Support for 0-100% rollout ranges

3. **Enhanced Flag Structure**
   - Add `rollout_percentage` field to FeatureFlag
   - Add `rollout_type` (e.g., "percentage", "whitelist", "blacklist")
   - Add `targeting_rules` for advanced conditions

4. **Rollout Evaluator**
   - New class to handle percentage-based evaluations
   - Integration with existing FeatureFlagEvaluator

### Follow-up Tasks Required

1. **High Priority**: Implement core percentage-based rollout functionality
   - Add rollout percentage field to FeatureFlag model
   - Create RolloutEvaluator class with bucketing logic
   - Update FeatureFlagEvaluator to use rollout logic

2. **Medium Priority**: Add user context support
   - Design user context interface
   - Implement consistent hashing for user bucketing
   - Add context parameter to evaluation methods

3. **Medium Priority**: Update CLI and storage
   - Extend CLI to support rollout percentage commands
   - Update JSON storage format for rollout data
   - Add validation for percentage values (0-100)

4. **Low Priority**: Add advanced rollout features
   - Implement targeting rules
   - Add rollout strategies (gradual, instant, scheduled)
   - Create rollout monitoring capabilities

### Recommendations
1. The task should be marked as "failed" or "incomplete" in the task management system
2. A proper implementation plan should be created before attempting the task again
3. The worker that claimed completion without doing actual work should be investigated
